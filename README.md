# Assignment-3
Programming university course registration system using the "Reactor" design pattern.
The Reactor is programmed in Java, running on your local machine, while the client programmed in C++.
Each client can register to the system, choose some of the available courses he is offered.
During this assignment we encountered various problems such as: two different clients trying to register to the same course
simultaneously while there's only one place availabe (AKA race condition) and solved them using the different solutions in such cases like this.
