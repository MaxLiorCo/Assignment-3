# Assignment-3
Programming university course registration system using the "Reactor" design pattern. <br>
The Reactor is programmed in Java, running on your local machine, while the client programmed in C++. <br>
Each client can register to the system, choose some of the available courses he is offered. <br>
During this assignment we encountered various problems such as: two different clients trying to register to the same course <br>
simultaneously while there's only one place availabe (AKA race condition) and solved them using the different solutions in such cases like this.
