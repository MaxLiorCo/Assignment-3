Programming a university course registration system using the "Reactor" design pattern. <br>
The Reactor is programmed in Java, running on your local machine, while the client (mimicing a student) programmed in C++. <br>
Each client can register to the system, log-in and choose some of the available courses he is offered. <br>
During this assignment we encountered various problems such as: two different clients trying to register to the same course <br>
simultaneously while there's only one place available (AKA race condition) and solved them using different solutions in such cases like this.
